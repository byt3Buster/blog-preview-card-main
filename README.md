## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learned to integrate the police files (.ttf) in the web pages. I improved my skills in terms of design thanks to this projet. When i applied a max-width: 320px; to my main, the image overflowed, it was pludit that i noticed that it was necessary to adapt the width of the image to that of the main(the parent).
